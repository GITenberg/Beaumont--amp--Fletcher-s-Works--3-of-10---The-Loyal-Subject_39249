<h3><i>Actus primus. Scena prima.</i></h3>


<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Theodor <i>and</i> Putskie.</p>

<p>
<i>The.</i> Captain, your friend's prefer'd, the Princess has her,<br />
Who, I assure my self, will use her nobly;<br />
A pretty sweet one 'tis indeed.<br />
<br />
<i>Put.</i> Well bred, Sir,<br />
I do deliver that upon my credit,<br />
And of an honest stock.<br />
<br />
<i>The.</i> It seems so, Captain,<br />
And no doubt will do well.<br />
<br />
<i>Put.</i> Thanks to your care, Sir;<br />
But tell me Noble Colonel, why this habit<br />
Of discontent is put on through the Army?<br />
And why your valiant Father, our great General,<br />
The hand that taught to strike, the Love that led all;<br />
Why he, that was the Father of the War,<br />
He that begot, and bred the Souldier,<br />
Why he sits shaking of his Arms, like Autumn,<br />
His Colours folded, and his Drums cas'd up,<br />
The tongue of War for ever ty'd within us?<br />
<br />
<i>The.</i> It must be so: Captain you are a stranger,<br />
But of a small time here a Souldier,<br />
Yet that time shews ye a right good, and great one,<br />
Else I could tell ye hours are strangely alter'd:<br />
The young Duke has too many eyes upon him,<br />
Too many fears 'tis thought too, and to nourish those,<br />
Maintains too many Instruments.<br />
<br />
<i>Put.</i> Turn their hearts,<br />
Or turn their heels up, Heaven: 'Tis strange it should be:<br />
The old Duke lov'd him dearly.<br />
<br />
<i>The.</i> He deserv'd it;<br />
And were he not my Father, I durst tell ye,<br />
The memorable hazards he has run through<br />
Deserv'd of this man too; highly deserv'd too;<br />
Had they been less, they had been safe <i>Putskie</i>,<br />
And sooner reach'd regard.<br />
<br />
<i>Put.</i> There you struck sure, Sir.<br />
<br />
<i>The.</i> Did I never tell thee of a vow he made<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>Some years before the old Duke dyed?<br />
<br />
<i>Put.</i> I have heard ye<br />
Speak often of that vow; but how it was,<br />
Or to what end, I never understood yet.<br />
<br />
<i>The.</i> I'le tell thee then: and then thou wilt find the reason:<br />
The last great Muster, ('twas before ye serv'd here,<br />
Before the last Dukes death, whose honour'd bones<br />
Now rest in peace) this young Prince had the ordering,<br />
(To Crown his Fathers hopes) of all the Army:<br />
Who (to be short) put all his power to practise;<br />
Fashion'd, and drew 'em up: but alas, so poorly,<br />
So raggedly and loosely, so unsouldier'd,<br />
The good Duke blush'd, and call'd unto my Father,<br />
<a name="p78_l14" id="p78_l14"></a>Who then was General: Go, <i>Archas</i>, speedily,<br />
<a name="p78_l15" id="p78_l15"></a>And chide the Boy, before the Souldiers find him,<br />
Stand thou between his ignorance and them,<br />
Fashion their bodies new to thy direction;<br />
Then draw thou up, and shew the Prince his errours.<br />
My Sire obey'd, and did so; with all duty<br />
Inform'd the Prince, and read him all directions:<br />
This bred distaste, distaste grew up to anger,<br />
And anger into wild words broke out thus:<br />
<a name="p78_l23" id="p78_l23"></a>Well, <i>Archas</i>, if I live but to command here,<br />
To be but Duke once, I shall then remember.<br />
I shall remember truly, trust me, I shall,<br />
And by my Fathers hand&mdash;the rest his eyes spoke.<br />
To which my Father answer'd (somewhat mov'd too)<br />
And with a vow he seal'd it: Royal Sir,<br />
Since for my faith and fights, your scorn and anger<br />
Only pursue me; if I live to that day,<br />
That day so long expected to reward me,<br />
By his so ever noble hand you swore by,<br />
And by the hand of Justice, never Arms more<br />
Shall rib this body in, nor sword hang here, Sir:<br />
The Conflicts I will do you service then in,<br />
Shall be repentant prayers: So they parted.<br />
<a name="p78_l37" id="p78_l37"></a>The time is come; and now ye know the wonder.<br />
<br />
<i>Put.</i> I find a fear too, which begins to tell me,<br />
The Duke will have but poor and slight defences,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>If his hot humour raign, and not his honour:<br />
How stand you with him, Sir?<br />
<br />
<i>The.</i> A perdue Captain,<br />
Full of my Fathers danger.<br />
<br />
<a name="p79_l4" id="p79_l4"></a><i>P</i>[<i>ut</i>]. He has rais'd a young man,<br />
They say a slight young man, I know him not,<br />
For what desert?<br />
<br />
<i>The.</i> Believe it, a brave Gentleman,<br />
Worth the Dukes respect, a clear sweet Gentleman,<br />
And of a noble soul: Come let's retire us,<br />
And wait upon my Father, who within this hour<br />
You will find an alter'd man.<br />
<br />
<i>Put.</i> I am sorry for't, Sir.      <span class="ralign">[<i>Exeunt.</i></span><br />

<h4>SCENE II.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Olympia, <i>and two Gentlewomen</i>.</p>

<p>
<i>Olym.</i> Is't not a handsome Wench?<br />
<br />
<i>2 Wom.</i> She is well enough, Madam:<br />
I have seen a better face, and a straighter body,<br />
And yet she is a pretty Gentlewoman.<br />
<br />
<i>Olym.</i> What thinkst thou <i>Petesca</i>?<br />
<br />
<i>Pet.</i> Alas, Madam, I have no skill, she has a black eye,<br />
Which is of the least too, and the dullest water:<br />
And when her mouth was made, for certain Madam,<br />
Nature intended her a right good stomach.<br />
<br />
<i>Olym.</i> She has a good hand.<br />
<br />
<i>2 Wom.</i> 'Tis good enough to hold fast,<br />
And strong enough to strangle the neck of a Lute.<br />
<br />
<i>Olym.</i> What think ye of her colour?<br />
<br />
<i>Pet.</i> If it be her own<br />
'Tis good black blood: right weather-proof<br />
I warrant it.<br />
<br />
<i>2 Wom.</i> What a strange pace she has got!<br />
<br />
<i>Olym.</i> That's but her breeding.<br />
<br />
<i>Pet.</i> And what a manly body! me thinks she looks<br />
As though she would pitch the Bar, or go to Buffets.<br />
<br />
<i>2 Wom.</i> Yet her behaviour's utterly against it,<br />
For me thinks she is too bashful.<br />
<br />
<i>Olym.</i> Is that hurtful?<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span><i>2 Wom.</i> Even equal to too bold: either of 'em, Madam,<br />
May do her injury when time shall serve her.<br />
<br />
<i>Olym.</i> You discourse learnedly, call in the wench.   <span class="ralign">[<i>Ex. Gent.</i></span><br />
What envious fools are you? Is the rule general,<br />
That Women can speak handsomly of none,<br />
But those they are bred withal?<br />
<br />
<i>Pet.</i> Scarce well of those, Madam,<br />
If they believe they may out-shine 'em any way:<br />
Our natures are like Oyl, compound us with any thing,<br />
Yet still we strive to swim o' th' top:<br />
Suppose there were here now,<br />
Now in this Court of <i>Mosco</i>, a stranger Princess,<br />
Of bloud and beauty equal to your excellence,<br />
As many eyes and services stuck on her;<br />
What would you think?<br />
<br />
<i>Olym.</i> I would think she might deserve it.<br />
<br />
<i>Pet.</i> Your Grace shall give me leave not to believe ye;<br />
I know you are a Woman, and so humour'd:<br />
I'le tell ye Madam, I could then get more Gowns on ye,<br />
More Caps and Feathers, more Scarfs, and more Silk-stockings<br />
With rocking you asleep with nightly railings<br />
Upon that Woman, than if I had nine lives<br />
I could wear out: by this hand ye'would scratch her eyes out.<br />
<br />
<i>Olym.</i> Thou art deceiv'd fool;<br />
<a name="p80_l24" id="p80_l24"></a>Now let your own eye mock ye.<br />
</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Gentlewoman and</i> Alinda.</p>

<p>
Come hither Girl: hang me and she be not a handsom one.<br />
<br />
<i>Pet.</i> I fear it will prove indeed so.<br />
<br />
<i>Olym.</i> Did you ever serve yet<br />
In any place of worth?<br />
<br />
<i>Alin.</i> No, Royal Lady.<br />
<br />
<i>Pet.</i> Hold up your head; fie.<br />
<br />
<i>Olym.</i> Let her alone, stand from her.<br />
<br />
<i>Alin.</i> It shall be now,<br />
Of all the blessings my poor youth has pray'd for,<br />
The greatest and the happiest to serve you;<br />
And might my promise carry but that credit<br />
To be believ'd, because I am yet a stranger,<br />
Excellent Lady, when I fall from duty,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>From all the service that my life can lend me,<br />
May everlasting misery then find me.<br />
<br />
<i>Olym.</i> What think ye now? I do believe, and thank ye;<br />
And sure I shall not be so far forgetful,<br />
To see that honest faith die unrewarded:<br />
What must I call your name?<br />
<br />
<i>Alin.</i> <i>Alinda</i>, Madam.<br />
<br />
<i>Olym.</i> Can ye sing?<br />
<br />
<i>Alin.</i> A little, when my grief will give me leave, Lady.<br />
<br />
<i>Olym.</i> What grief canst thou have Wench?<br />
Thou art not in love?<br />
<br />
<i>Alin.</i> If I be Madam, 'tis only with your goodness;<br />
For yet I never saw that man I sighed for.<br />
<br />
<i>Olym.</i> Of what years are you?<br />
<br />
<i>Alin.</i> My Mother oft has told me,<br />
That very day and hour this land was blest<br />
With your most happy birth, I first saluted<br />
This worlds fair light: Nature was then so busie,<br />
And all the Graces to adorn your goodness,<br />
I stole into the world poor and neglected.<br />
<br />
<i>Olym.</i> Something there was, when I first look'd upon thee,<br />
Made me both like and love thee: now I know it;<br />
And you shall find that knowledge shall not hurt you:<br />
I hope ye are a Maid?<br />
<br />
<i>Alin.</i> I hope so too, Madam;<br />
I am sure for any man: and were I otherwise,<br />
Of all the services my hopes could point at,<br />
I durst not touch at yours.<br />
</p>

<p class="center"><i>Flourish. Enter Duke</i>, Burris, <i>and Gent.</i></p>

<p>
<i>Pet.</i> The great Duke, Madam.<br />
<br />
<i>Duk.</i> Good morrow, Sister.<br />
<br />
<i>Olym.</i> A good day to your highness.<br />
<br />
<i>Duk.</i> I am come to pray you use no more perswasions<br />
For this old stubborn man: nay to command ye:<br />
His sail is swell'd too full: he is grown too insolent,<br />
Too self-affected, proud: those poor slight services<br />
He has done my Father, and my self, has blown him<br />
To such a pitch, he flyes to stoop our favours.<br />
<br />
<i>Olym.</i> I am sorry Sir: I ever thought those services<br />
Both great and noble.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span><br />
<i>Bur.</i> However, may it please ye<br />
But to consider 'em a true hearts Servants,<br />
Done out of faith to you, and not self-fame:<br />
<a name="p82_l4" id="p82_l4"></a>Do but consider royal Sir, the dangers;<br />
When you have slept secure, the mid-night tempests,<br />
That as he marcht sung through his aged locks;<br />
When you have fed at full, the wants and famins;<br />
The fires of Heaven, when you have found all temperate,<br />
Death with his thousand doors&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Duk.</i> I have consider'd;<br />
No more: and that I will have, shall be.<br />
<br />
<i>Olym.</i> For the best,<br />
I hope all still.<br />
<br />
<i>Duk.</i> What handsom wench is that there?<br />
<br />
<i>Olym.</i> My Servant, Sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Duk.</i> Prethee observe her <i>Burris</i>,<br />
Is she not wondrous handsom? speak thy freedom.<br />
<br />
<i>Bur.</i> She appears no less to me Sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Duk.</i> Of whence is she?<br />
<br />
<i>Ol.</i> Her Father I am told is a good Gentleman,<br />
But far off dwelling: her desire to serve me<br />
Brought her to th' Court, and here her friends have left her.<br />
<br />
<i>Du.</i> She may find better friends:<br />
Ye are welcom fair one,<br />
I have not seen a sweeter: By your Ladies leave:<br />
Nay stand up sweet, we'll have no superstition:<br />
You have got a Servant; you may use him kindly,<br />
And he may honour ye:       <span class="ralign">[<i>Ex.</i> Duke <i>and</i> Burris.</span><br />
Good morrow Sister.<br />
<br />
<i>Ol.</i> Good morrow to your Grace. How the wench blushes!<br />
<a name="p82_l31" id="p82_l31"></a>How like an A[n]gel now she looks!<br />
<br />
<i>1 Wom.</i> At first jump<br />
Jump into the Dukes arms? we must look to you,<br />
Indeed we must, the next jump we are journeymen.<br />
<br />
<i>Pet.</i> I see the ruine of our hopes already,<br />
Would she were at home again, milking her Fathers Cows.<br />
<br />
<i>1 Wom.</i> I fear she'l milk all the great Courtiers first.<br />
<br />
<i>Olym.</i> This has not made ye proud?<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> No certain, Madam.<br />
<br />
<i>Olym.</i> It was the Duke that kist ye.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span><br />
<i>Al.</i> 'Twas your Brother,<br />
And therefore nothing can be meant but honour.<br />
<br />
<i>Ol.</i> But say he love ye?<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> That he may with safety:<br />
A Princes love extends to all his subjects.<br />
<br />
<i>Ol.</i> But say in more particular?<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> Pray fear not:<br />
For vertues sake deliver me from doubts, Lady:<br />
'Tis not the name of King, nor all his promises,<br />
His glories, and his greatness stuck about me,<br />
Can make me prove a Traitor to your service:<br />
You are my Mistris, and my noble Master,<br />
Your vertues my ambition, and your favour<br />
The end of all my love, and all my fortune:<br />
And when I fail in that faith&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Ol.</i> I believe thee,<br />
Come wipe your eyes; I do: take you example&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Pets.</i> I would her eyes were out.<br />
<br />
<i>1 Wom.</i> If the wind stand in this door,<br />
We shall have but cold custome: some trick or other,<br />
And speedily.<br />
<br />
<i>Pet.</i> Let me alone to think on't.<br />
<br />
<i>Ol.</i> Come, be you near me still.<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> With all my duty.      <span class="ralign">[<i>Exeunt.</i></span><br />

<h4>SCENA III.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Archas, Theodor, Putskie, <i>Ancient, and Souldiers,
carrying his armour piece-meale, his Colours wound up,
and his Drums in Cases</i>.</p>

<p>
<i>Theod.</i> This is the heaviest march we e're trod Captain.<br />
<br />
<i>Puts.</i> This was not wont to be: these honour'd pieces<br />
The fierie god of war himself would smile at,<br />
Buckl'd upon that body, were not wont thus,<br />
Like Reliques to be offer'd to long rust,<br />
And heavy-ey'd oblivion brood upon 'em.<br />
<br />
<i>Arch.</i> There set 'em down: and glorious war farewel;<br />
Thou child of honour and ambitious thoughts,<br />
Begot in bloud, and nurs'd with Kingdomes ruines;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>Thou golden danger, courted by thy followers<br />
Through fires and famins, for one title from thee&mdash;<br />
Prodigal man-kind spending all his fortunes;<br />
A long farewel I give thee: Noble Arms,<br />
You ribs for mighty minds, you Iron houses,<br />
Made to defie the thunder-claps of Fortune,<br />
Rust and consuming time must now dwell with ye:<br />
And thou good Sword that knewst the way to conquest,<br />
Upon whose fatal edge despair and death dwelt,<br />
That when I shook thee thus, fore-shew'd destruction,<br />
Sleep now from bloud, and grace my Monument:<br />
Farewel my Eagle; when thou flew'st, whole Armies<br />
Have stoopt below thee: At Passage I have seen thee,<br />
Ruffle the <i>Tartars</i>, as they fled thy furie;<br />
And bang 'em up together, as a Tassel,<br />
Upon the streach, a flock of fearfull Pigeons.<br />
I yet remember when the <i>Volga</i> curl'd,<br />
The aged <i>Volga</i>, when he heav'd his head up,<br />
And rais'd his waters high, to see the ruins;<br />
The ruines our Swords made, the bloudy ruins,<br />
Then flew this Bird of honour bravely, Gentlemen;<br />
But these must be forgotten: so must these too,<br />
And all that tend to Arms, by me for ever.<br />
Take 'em you holy men; my Vow take with 'em,<br />
Never to wear 'em more: Trophies I give 'em,<br />
And sacred Rites of war to adorn the Temple:<br />
There let 'em hang, to tell the world their master<br />
Is now Devotions Souldier, fit for prayer.<br />
Why do ye hang your heads? why look you sad friends?<br />
I am not dying yet.<br />
<br />
<i>Theod.</i> Ye are indeed to us Sir.<br />

And that will be a task too to a Souldier:<br />

Of what I have done, I think I should have ventur'd<br />

To have broke one staff more handsomly, and have died<br />

Now shew the manly pureness of thy mettle;<br />
Now if thou beest that valued man, that vertue,<br />
That great obedience teaching all, now stand it.<br />
What I have said forget, my youth was hasty,<br />
And what you said your self forgive, you were angry.<br />
If men could live without their faults, they were gods, <i>Archas</i>.<br />
He weeps, and holds his hands up: to him, <i>Burris</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Bur.</i> You have shew'd the Prince his faults;<br />
And like a good Surgeon you have laid<br />
That to 'em makes 'em smart; he feels it,<br />
Let 'em not fester now, Sir; your own honour,<br />
The bounty of that mind, and your allegiance,<br />
'Gainst which I take it, Heaven gives no Command, Sir,<br />
Nor seals no Vow, can better teach ye now<br />
What ye have to do, than I, or this necessity;<br />

Then were you sworn for Vertues Cause, for Beauties,<br />

<p>
<i>Duke.</i> No news of <i>Archas</i> yet?<br />
<br />
<i>Bur.</i> But now, and't please ye,<br />
A Post came in, Letters he brought none with him,<br />
But this deliver'd: He saw the Armies join,<br />
The game of Blood begun, and by our General,<br />
Who never was acquainted but with Conquest,<br />
So bravely fought, he saw the <i>Tartars</i> shaken,<br />
And there he said he left 'em.<br />

This News should make ye lightsome, bring joy to ye,<br />
It strikes our hearts with general Comfort.     <span class="ralign">[<i>Exit Duke.</i></span><br />

Has crost him since the General went?<br />
<br />
<i>Bur.</i> Not any:<br />
If there had been, I am sure I should have found it:<br />
Only I have heard him oft complain for money:<br />
Money he says he wants.<br />

I fear some new thing hatching.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke.</i> Come hither <i>Burris</i>.<br />
Go see my Sister, and commend me to her,<br />

When he comes home, take heed the Court receive him not,<br />
Take heed he meet not with their loves and praises,<br />
That Glass will shew him ten times greater, Sir,<br />
(And make him strive to make good that proportion,)<br />
Than ere his fortune bred him, he is honourable,<br />
At least I strive to understand him so,<br />
And of a nature, if not this way poyson'd,<br />
Perfect enough, easie, and sweet, but those are soon seduc'd, Sir;<br />
He's a great man, and what that Pill may work,<br />
Prepar'd by general voices of the people,<br />
Is the end of all my Counsel, only this, Sir,<br />
Let him retire a while, there's more hangs by it<br />
Than you know yet: there if he stand a while well,<br />

I bring no tales, nor flatteries: in my tongue, Sir,<br />
I carry no fork'd stings.<br />

I have business to the Duke.<br />

And cannot now be spoke withal.<br />
<br />
<i>The.</i> Not well, Sir?<br />
How would he ha' been, if we had lost? not well, Sir?<br />
I bring him news to make him well: his enemy<br />
That would have burnt his City here, and your House too,<br />
Your brave gilt house, my Lord, your honours hangings,<br />
Where all your Ancestors, and all their Battels,<br />
Their silk and golden Battels are decipher'd:<br />
That would not only have abus'd your buildings,<br />
Your goodly buildings, Sir, and have drunk dry your butteries,<br />
Purloin'd your Lordships Plate, the Duke bestow'd on you,<br />
For turning handsomly o'th' toe, and trim'd your Virgins,<br />
Trim'd 'em of a new cut, and't like your Lordship,<br />
'Tis ten to one, your Wife too, and the curse is<br />
You had had no remedy against these Rascals,<br />
No Law, and't like your Honour; would have kill'd you too<br />
And roasted ye, and eaten ye, ere this time:<br />
Notable Knaves my Lord, unruly Rascals:<br />
These youths have we ty'd up, put muzzels on 'em,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>And par'd their Nails, that honest civil Gentlemen,<br />
And such most noble persons as your self is,<br />
May live in peace, and rule the land with a twine thread.<br />
These news I bring.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> And were they thus deliver'd ye?<br />
<br />
<i>The.</i> My Lord, I am no pen-man, nor no Orator,<br />
My tongue was never Oyl'd with Here and't like ye,<br />
There I beseech ye, weigh, I am a Souldier,<br />
And truth I covet only, no fine terms, Sir;<br />
I come not to stand treating here; my business<br />
Is with the Duke, and of such general blessing&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> You have overthrown the enemy, we know it,<br />
And we rejoyce in't; ye have done like honest Subjects,<br />
You have done handsomely and well.<br />
<br />
<i>Theo.</i> But well, Sir?<br />
But handsomely and well? what are we juglers?<br />
I'le do all that in cutting up a Capon.<br />
But handsomely and well? does your Lordship take us<br />
For the Dukes Tumblers? we have done bravely, Sir,<br />
Ventur'd our lives like men.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> Then bravely be it.<br />
<br />
<i>Theo.</i> And for as brave rewards we look, and graces,<br />
We have sweat and bled for't, Sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> And ye may have it,<br />
If you will stay the giving. Men that thank themselves first<br />
For any good they do, take off the lustre,<br />
And blot the benefit.<br />
<br />
<i>Theo.</i> Are these the welcomes,<br />
The Bells that ring out our rewards? pray heartily,<br />
Early and late, there may be no more Enemies:<br />
Do my good Lord, pray seriously, and sigh too,<br />
For if there be&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> They must be met, and fought with.<br />
<br />
<i>Theo.</i> By whom? by you? they must be met and flatter'd.<br />
Why, what a Devil ail'd ye to do these things?<br />
With what assurance dare ye mock men thus?<br />
You have but single lives, and those I take it<br />
A Sword may find too: why do ye dam the Duke up?<br />
And choak that course of love, that like a River<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>Should fill our empty veins again with comforts?<br />

Pray use this old man so, and then we are paid all.<br />
The Duke thanks ye for your service, and the Court thanks ye,<br />
And wonderful desirous they are to see ye;<br />
Pray Heaven we have room enough to march for May-games,<br />
Pageants, and Bone-fires for your welcome home, Sir.<br />
Here your most noble friend the Lord <i>Boroskie</i>,<br />
A Gentleman too tender of your credit,<br />
And ever in the Dukes ear, for your good, Sir,<br />
Crazie and sickly, yet to be your servant,<br />
Has leapt into the open air to meet ye.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> The best is, your words wound not, you are welcome home, Sir;<br />
Heartily welcome home, and for your service,<br />
The noble overthrow you gave the Enemy,<br />
The Duke salutes ye too with all his thanks, Sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Anc.</i> Sure they will now regard us.<br />
<br />
<i>Puts.</i> There's a reason:<br />
But by the changing of the Colonels countenance,<br />
The rolling of his eyes like angry Billows;<br />
I fear the wind's not down yet, <i>Ancient</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Anc.</i> Is the Duke well, Sir?<br />
<br />
<i>Boros.</i> Not much unhealthy,<br />
Only a little grudging of an Ague,<br />
Which cannot last: he has heard, which makes him fearful,<br />
And loth as yet to give your worth due welcome,<br />
The sickness hath been somewhat hot i'th' Army,<br />
Which happily may prove more doubt than danger,<br />
And more his fear than fate; yet howsoever,<br />
An honest care&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Arch.</i> Ye say right, and it shall be;<br />
For though upon my life 'tis but a rumor,<br />
A meer opinion, without faith or fear in't;<br />
For Sir, I thank Heaven, we never stood more healthy,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>Never more high and lusty; yet to satisfie,<br />
We cannot be too curious, or too careful<br />
Of what concerns his state, we'll draw away, Sir,<br />
And lodge at further distance, and less danger.<br />
<br />
<i>Boros.</i> It will be well.<br />
<br />
<i>Anc.</i> It will be very scurvy:<br />
I smell it out, it stinks abominably,<br />
Stir it no more.<br />
<br />
<i>Boros.</i> The Duke, Sir, would have you too,<br />
For a short day or two, retire to your own house,<br />
Whither himself will come to visit ye,<br />
And give ye thanks.<br />
<br />
<i>Arch.</i> I shall attend his pleasure.<br />
<br />
<i>Anc.</i> A trick, a lousie trick: so ho, a trick Boys.<br />
<br />
<i>Arch.</i> How now, what's that?<br />
<br />
<i>Anc.</i> I thought I had found a Hare, Sir,<br />
But 'tis a Fox, an old Fox, shall we hunt him?<br />
<br />
<i>Arch.</i> No more such words.<br />
<br />
<i>Boros.</i> The Souldier's grown too sawcy,<br />
You must tie him straiter up.<br />
<br />
<i>Arch.</i> I do my best, Sir;<br />
But men of free-born minds sometimes will flie out.<br />
<br />
<i>Anc.</i> May not we see the Duke?<br />
<br />
<i>Boros.</i> Not at this time, Gentlemen,<br />
Your General knows the cause.<br />
<br />
<i>Anc.</i> We have no Plague, Sir,<br />
Unless it be in our pay, nor no Pox neither;<br />
Or if we had, I hope that good old Courtier<br />
Will not deny us place there.<br />
<br />
<i>Puts.</i> Certain my Lord,<br />
Considering what we are, and what we have done;<br />
If not, what need ye may have, 'twould be better,<br />
A great deal nobler, and taste honester<br />
To use us with more sweetness; men that dig<br />
And lash away their lives at the Carts tail,<br />
Double our comforts; meat, and their Masters thanks too,<br />
When they work well, they have; Men of our quality,<br />
When they do well, and venture for't with valour,<br />
Fight hard, lye hard, feed hard, when they come home, Sir,<br />
And know these are deserving things, things worthy,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>Can you then blame 'em if their minds a little<br />
Be stir'd with glory? 'tis a pride becomes 'em,<br />
A little season'd with ambition,<br />
To be respected, reckon'd well, and honour'd<br />
For what they have done: when to come home thus poorly,<br />
And met with such unjointed joy, so looked on,<br />
As if we had done no more but drest a Horse well;<br />
So entertain'd, as if, I thank ye Gentlemen,<br />
Take that to drink, had pow'r to please a Souldier?<br />
Where be the shouts, the Bells rung out, the people?<br />
The Prince himself?<br />
<br />
<i>Arch.</i> Peace: I perceive your eye, Sir,<br />
Is fixt upon this Captain for his freedom,<br />
And happily you find his tongue too forward;<br />
As I am Master of the place I carry,<br />
'Tis fit I think so too; but were I this man,<br />
No stronger tie upon me, than the truth<br />
And tongue to tell it, I should speak as he do's,<br />
And think with modesty enough, such Saints<br />
That daily thrust their loves and lives through hazards,<br />
And fearless for their Countries peace, march hourly<br />
Through all the doors of death, and know the darkest,<br />
Should better be canoniz'd for their service:<br />
What labour would these men neglect, what danger<br />
Where honour is, though seated in a Billow,<br />
Rising as high as Heaven, would not these Souldiers,<br />
Like to so many Sea-gods charge up to it?<br />
Do you see these swords? times Sythe was ne'er so sharp, Sir;<br />
Nor ever at one harvest mow'd such handfuls:<br />
Thoughts ne'er so sudden, nor belief so sure<br />
When they are drawn, and were it not sometimes<br />
I swim upon their angers to allay 'em,<br />
And like a calm depress their fell intentions;<br />
They are so deadly sure, nature would suffer&mdash;<br />
And whose are all these glories? why, their Princes,<br />
Their Countries, and their Friends? Alas, of all these,<br />
And all the happy ends they bring, the blessings,<br />
They only share the labours: A little joy then,<br />
And outside of a welcome, at an upshot<br />
Would not have done amiss, Sir; but howsoever<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>Between me and my duty, no crack, Sir,<br />
Shall dare appear: I hope by my example<br />
No discontent in them: without doubt Gentlemen,<br />
The Duke will both look suddenly and truly<br />
On your deserts: Methinks 'twere good they were paid, Sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> They shall be immediately; I stay for money;<br />
And any favour else&mdash;<br />

And can this cure 'em? you should have us'd us nobly,<br />

My Lord, that I am no Courtier, you may guess it<br />
By having no sute to you for this mony:<br />
For though I want, I want not this, nor shall not,<br />
Whilst you want that civility to rank it<br />
With those rights we expected; mony grows Sir,<br />
And men must gather it, all is not put in one purse.<br />
And that I am no Carter, I could never whistle yet:<br />
But that I am a Souldier, and a Gentleman,<br />

If those might only sway him: but 'tis most certain,<br />
So many new born Flies his light gave life to,<br />
Buzze in his beams, Flesh-flies, and Butterflies,<br />
Hornets, and humming Scarabs, that not one honey Bee<br />
That's loaden with true labour, and brings home<br />

<h4>SCENE II.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Archas, Honora, <i>and</i> Viola.</p>

<p>
<i>Ar.</i> No more, it must be so; do you think I would send ye,<br />
Your father and your friend&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Viol.</i> Pray Sir, be good to us,<br />
Alas, we know no Court, nor seek that knowledge;<br />
<a name="p117_l21" id="p117_l21"></a>We are content with harmless things at home,<br />
Children of your content, bred up in quiet,<br />
Only to know our selves, to seek a Wisedome<br />
From that we understand, easie and honest;<br />
To make our actions worthy of your Honour,<br />
Their ends as innocent as we begot 'em;<br />
What shall we look for Sir, what shall we learn there,<br />
That this more private sweetness cannot teach us?<br />
Vertue was never built upon ambition,<br />
Nor the Souls Beauties bred out of Bravery:<br />
What a terrible Father would you seem to us,<br />
Now you have moulded us, and wrought our tempers<br />
To easie and obedient ways, uncrooked,<br />
Where the fair mind can never lose nor loiter,<br />
Now to divert our Natures, now to stem us<br />
Roughly against the tide of all this treasure?<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>Would ye have us proud? 'tis sooner bred than buried;<br />
Wickedly proud? for such things dwell at Court, Sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Hon.</i> Would ye have your Children learn to forget their father,<br />
And when he dies dance on his Monument?<br />
Shall we seek Vertue in a Sattin Gown;<br />
Embroider'd Vertue? Faith in a well-curl'd Feather?<br />
And set our Credits to the tune of green sleeves?<br />
This may be done; and if you like, it shall be.<br />
You should have sent us thither when we were younger,<br />
Our maiden-heads at a higher rate; our Innocence<br />
Able to make a Mart indeed: we are now too old, Sir,<br />
Perhaps they'll think too cunning too, and slight us;<br />
Besides, we are altogether unprovided,<br />
Unfurnisht utterly of the rules should guide us:<br />
This Lord comes, licks his hand, and protests to me;<br />
Compares my Beauty to a thousand fine things;<br />
Mountains, and Fountains, Trees, and Stars, and Goblins;<br />
<a name="p118_l17" id="p118_l17"></a>Now have not I the faith for to believe him;<br />
He offers me the honourable courtesie,<br />
To lye with me all night, what a misery is this?<br />
I am bred up so foolishly, alas, I dare not,<br />
And how madly these things will shew there.<br />
<br />
<i>Arc.</i> I send ye not,<br />
Like parts infected, to draw more corruption;<br />
Like Spiders to grow great, with growing evil:<br />
With your own Vertues season'd, and my prayers,<br />
The Card of goodness in your minds, that shows ye<br />
When ye sail false; the needle toucht with honour,<br />
That through the blackest storms, still points at happiness;<br />
Your Bodies the tall barks, rib'd round with goodness,<br />
Your Heavenly Souls the Pilots, thus I send you;<br />
Thus I prepare your Voyage; sound before ye,<br />
And ever as you sail through this Worlds Vanity,<br />
Discover Sholes, Rocks, Quicksands, cry out to ye,<br />
Like a good Master tack about for Honour:<br />
The Court is Vertue's School, at least it should be;<br />
Nearer the Sun the Mine lies, the metal's purer:<br />
Be it granted, if the spring be once infected,<br />
Those Branches that flow from him must run muddy;<br />
Say you find some Sins there, and those no small ones,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>And they like lazie fits begin to shake ye:<br />
Say they affect your strengths, my happy Children,<br />
Great things through greatest hazards are atchiev'd still,<br />
And then they shine, then goodness has his glory,<br />
His Crown fast rivetted, then time moves under,<br />
Where, through the mist of errors, like the Sun,<br />
Through thick and pitchy Clouds, he breaks out nobly.<br />
<br />
<i>Hon.</i> I thank you Sir, you have made me half a Souldier,<br />
I will to Court most willingly, most fondly.<br />
And if there be such stirring things amongst 'em,<br />
Such Travellers into <i>Virginia</i><br />
As Fame reports, if they can win me, take me;<br />
I think I have a close Ward, and a sure one;<br />
An honest mind I hope, 'tis petticoat-proof,<br />
Chain-proof, and Jewel-proof; I know 'tis Gold-proof,<br />
A Coach and four Horses cannot draw me from it:<br />
As for your handsome Faces, and filed Tongues,<br />
Curl'd Millers heads, I have another word for them,<br />
And yet I'll flatter too, as fast as they do,<br />
And lye, but not as lewdly; Come, be valiant, Sister,<br />
She that dares not stand the push o'th' Court, dares nothing,<br />
<a name="p119_l21" id="p119_l21"></a>And yet come off ungraced: Sir, like you,<br />
We both affect great dangers now, and the World shall see<br />
All glory lies not in Mans Victorie.<br />
<br />
<i>Arc.</i> Mine own <i>Honora</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Viol.</i> I am very fearful,<br />
Would I were stronger built: you would have me honest?<br />
<br />
<i>Arc.</i> Or not at all my <i>Viola</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Viol.</i> I'll think on't,<br />
For 'tis no easie promise, and live there:<br />
Do you think we shall do well?<br />
<br />
<i>Hon.</i> Why, what should aile us?<br />
<br />
<i>Viol.</i> Certain they'll tempt us strongly; beside the glory<br />
Which Women may affect, they are handsom Gentlemen,<br />
Every part speaks: nor is it one denial,<br />
Nor two, nor ten; from every look we give 'em,<br />
They'll frame a hope; even from our prayers, promises.<br />
<br />
<i>Hon.</i> Let 'em feed so, and be fat; there is no fear, wench,<br />
<a name="p119_l38" id="p119_l38"></a>I[f] thou beest fast to thy self.<br />
<br />
<i>Viol.</i> I hope I shall be;<br />
And your example will work more.<br />

<br />

I hear you let out money.<br />
<br />
<i>Arc.</i> Very well, Sir,<br />
You are pleasantly dispos'd: I am glad to see it.<br />
Can you lend me your patience, and be rul'd by me?<br />
<br />
<i>The.</i> Is't come to patience now?<br />
<br />
<i>Arc.</i> Is't not a Vertue?<br />
<br />
<i>The.</i> I know not: I ne'r found it so.<br />
<br />
<i>Arc.</i> That's because<br />
Thy anger ever knows, and not thy judgment.<br />
<br />
<i>The.</i> I know you have been rifl'd.<br />
<br />
<i>Arc.</i> Nothing less, Boy;<br />
Lord, what opinions these vain People publish!<br />
Rifl'd of what?<br />
<br />
<i>The.</i> Study your Vertue, Patience,<br />
It may get Mustard to your Meat. Why in such haste, Sir,<br />
Sent ye for me?<br />
<br />
<i>Arc.</i> For this end only, <i>Theodore</i>,<br />
To wait upon your Sisters to the Court;<br />
I am commanded they live there.<br />
<br />
<i>The.</i> To th' Court, Sir?<br />
<br />
<i>Arc.</i> To th' Court I say.<br />
<br />
<i>The.</i> And must I wait upon 'em?<br />
<br />
<i>Arc.</i> Yes, 'tis most fit you should, you are their Brother.<br />
<br />
<i>The.</i> Is this the business? I had thought your mind, Sir,<br />
Had been set forward on some noble action,<br />
Something had truly stir'd ye.  To th' Court with these?<br />
Why, they are your Daughters, Sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Arc.</i> All this I know, Sir.<br />
<br />
<i>The.</i> The good old Woman on a Bed he threw:<br />
To th' Court?<br />
<br />
<a name="p120_l34" id="p120_l34"></a><i>Arc.</i> Thou art mad.<br />
<br />
<i>The.</i> Nor drunk as you are:<br />
Drunk with your duty, Sir: do you call it duty?<br />
A pox of duty, what can these do there?<br />
What should they do? Can ye look Babies, Sisters,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>In the young Gallants eyes, and twirl their Band-strings?<br />
Can ye ride out to air your selves? Pray Sir,<br />
Be serious with me, do you speak this truly?<br />
<br />
<i>Arc.</i> Why, didst thou never hear of Women<br />
Yet at Court, Boy?<br />
<br />
<i>The.</i> Yes, and good Women too, very good Women,<br />
Excellent honest Women: but are you sure, Sir,<br />
That these will prove so?<br />
<br />
<i>Hon.</i> There's the danger, Brother.<br />
<br />
<i>The.</i> God-a-mercy Wench, thou hast a grudging of it.<br />
<br />
<i>Arc.</i> Now be you serious, Sir, and observe what I say,<br />
Do it, and do it handsomly; go with 'em.<br />
<br />
<i>The.</i> With all my heart, Sir; I am in no fault now;<br />
If they be thought Whores for being in my Company;<br />
Pray write upon their Backs, they are my Sisters,<br />
And where I shall deliver 'em.<br />
<br />
<i>Arc.</i> Ye are wondrous jocund,<br />
But prithee tell me, art thou so lewd a Fellow?<br />
I never knew thee fail a truth.<br />
<br />
<i>The.</i> I am a Souldier,<br />
And spell you what that means.<br />
<br />
<i>Arc.</i> A Souldier?<br />
What dost thou make of me?<br />
<br />
<i>The.</i> Your Palate's down, Sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Arc.</i> I thank ye, Sir.<br />
<br />
<i>The.</i> Come, shall we to this matter?<br />
You will to Court?<br />
<br />
<i>Hon.</i> If you will please to honour us.<br />
<br />
<i>The.</i> I'll honour ye, I warrant; I'll set ye off<br />
With such a lustre, Wenches; alas poor <i>Viola</i>,<br />
Thou art a fool, thou criest for eating white bread:<br />
Be a good Huswife of thy tears, and save 'em,<br />
Thou wilt have time enough to shed 'em, Sister.<br />
Do you weep too? nay, then I'll fool no more.<br />
Come worthy Sisters, since it must be so,<br />
And since he thinks it fit to try your Vertues,<br />
Be you as strong to truth, as I to guard ye,<br />

But happily&mdash;<br />
<br />

With all my service I should follow ye,<br />

<br />
<i>Bor.</i> More than ever,<br />
No Law nor Justice frights 'em: all the Town over<br />
They play new pranks and gambols: no mans person,<br />
Of what degree soever, free from abuses:<br />
And durst they doe this, (let your grace consider)<br />
These monstrous, most offensive things, these villanies,<br />
If not set on, and fed? if not by one<br />
They honour more than you? and more aw'd by him?<br />
<br />
<i>Duke.</i> Happily their own wants.<br />
<br />
<i>Boros.</i> I offer to supply 'em,<br />
And every hour make tender of their moneys:<br />
They scorn it, laugh at me that offer it:<br />
I fear the next device will be my life Sir;<br />
And willingly I'le give it, so they stay there.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke.</i> Do you think Lord <i>Archas</i> privie?<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span><br />
<i>Bor.</i> More than thought,<br />
I know it Sir, I know they durst not doe<br />

Welcom to th' court sweet beauties; now the court shines,<br />
When such true beams of beauty strike amongst us:<br />
Welcom, welcom, even as your own joyes welcom.<br />
How do you like the Court? how seems it to you?<br />
Is't not a place created for all sweetness?<br />
Why were you made such strangers to this happiness?<br />
Barr'd the delights this holds? the richest jewels<br />
Set ne're so well, if then not worn to wonder,<br />
By judging eyes not set off, lose their lustre:<br />
Your Country shades are faint; blasters of beauty;<br />
The manners like the place, obscure and heavie;<br />
<a name="p140_l27" id="p140_l27"></a>The Rose buds of the beauties turn to cankers,<br />
Eaten with inward thoughts: whilst there ye wander.<br />
Here Ladies, here, you were not made for Cloisters,<br />
Here is the Sphere you move in: here shine nobly,<br />
And by your powerfull influence command all:<br />
What a sweet modestie dwells round about 'em,<br />
And like a nipping morn pulls in their blossoms?<br />
<br />
<i>Hon.</i> Your grace speaks cunningly, you doe not this,<br />
I hope Sir, to betray us; we are poor triumphs;<br />
Nor can our loss of honour adde to you Sir:<br />
Great men, and great thoughts, seek things great and worthy,<br />
Subjects to make 'em live, and not to lose 'em;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>Conquests so nobly won, can never perish;<br />
We are two simple maids, untutor'd here Sir;<br />
Two honest maids, is that a sin at Court Sir?<br />
Our breeding is obedience, but to good things,<br />
To vertuous and to fair: what wou'd you win on us?<br />
Why do I ask that question, when I have found ye?<br />
Your Preamble has pour'd your heart out to us;<br />
You would dishonour us; which in your translation<br />
Here at the Court reads thus, your grace would love us,<br />
Most dearly love us: stick us up for mistresses:<br />
Most certain, there are thousands of our sex Sir<br />
That would be glad of this, and handsom women,<br />
And crowd into this favour, fair young women,<br />
Excellent beauties Sir: when ye have enjoy'd 'em,<br />
And suckt those sweets they have, what Saints are these then?<br />
What worship have they won? what name you ghess Sir,<br />
What storie added to their time, a sweet one?<br />
<br />

The goodliest Gentleman; take that hope with ye;<br />
And were I fit to be your wife (so much I honour ye)<br />
Trust me I would scratch for ye but I would have ye.<br />
I would wooe you then.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke.</i> She amazes me:<br />
But how am I deceiv'd?<br />
<br />
<i>Hon.</i> O we are too honest,<br />
Believe it Sir, too honest, far too honest,<br />
The way that you propound too ignorant,<br />
And there is no medling with us; for we are fools too,<br />
Obstinate, peevish fools: if I would be ill,<br />
And had a wantons itch, to kick my heels up,<br />
I would not leap into th' Sun, and doe't there,<br />
That all the world might see me: an obscure shade Sir,<br />
Dark as the deed, there is no trusting light with it,<br />

Yet one I dare assure my Soul, that lov'd ye<br />
Before she saw ye; doted on your Vertues;<br />
Before she knew those fair eyes, long'd to read 'em,<br />
You only had her prayers, you her wishes;<br />
And that one hope to be yours once, preserv'd her.<br />
<br />
<i>Olym.</i> I have done wickedly.<br />
<br />
<i>Alin.</i> A little Beauty,<br />
Such as a Cottage breeds, she brought along with her;<br />
And yet our Country-eyes esteem'd it much too:<br />
But for her beauteous mind, forget great Lady,<br />
I am her Brother, and let me speak a stranger,<br />
Since she was able to beget a thought, 'twas honest.<br />
The daily study how to fit your services,<br />
Truly to tread that vertuous path you walk in,<br />
So fir'd her honest Soul, we thought her Sainted;<br />
I presume she is still the same: I would fain see her,<br />
For Madam, 'tis no little love I owe her.<br />
<br />
<i>Olym.</i> Sir, such a maid there was, I had&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Alin.</i> There was, Madam?<br />
<br />
<i>Olym.</i> O my poor Wench: eyes, I will ever curse ye<br />
For your Credulity, <i>Alinda</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Alin.</i> That's her name, Madam.<br />
<br />
<i>Olym.</i> Give me a little leave, Sir, to lament her.<br />
<br />
<i>Alin.</i> Is she dead, Lady?<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span><br />
<i>Olym.</i> Dead, Sir, to my service.<br />
She is gone, pray ye ask no further.<br />
<br />
<i>Alin.</i> I obey Madam:<br />
Gone? now must I lament too: said ye gone Madam?<br />
<br />
<i>Olym.</i> Gone, gone for ever.<br />
<br />
<i>Alin.</i> That's a cruel saying:<br />
Her honour too?<br />
<br />
<i>Olym.</i> Prithee look angry on me,<br />
And if thou ever lovedst her, spit upon me;<br />
Do something like a Brother, like a friend,<br />
And do not only say thou lov'st her&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> Ye amaze me.<br />
<br />
<i>Oly.</i> I ruin'd her, I wrong'd her, I abus'd her;<br />
Poor innocent soul, I flung her; sweet <i>Alinda</i>,<br />
Thou vertuous maid, my soul now calls thee vertuous.<br />
Why do ye not rail now at me?<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> For what Lady?<br />
<br />
<i>Oly.</i> Call me base treacherous woman.<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> Heaven defend me.<br />
<br />
<i>Oly.</i> Rashly I thought her false, and put her from me,<br />
Rashly, and madly I betrai'd her modesty,<br />
Put her to wander, heaven knows where: nay, more Sir,<br />
Stuck a black brand upon her.<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> 'Twas not well Lady.<br />
<br />
<i>Oly.</i> 'Twas damnable: she loving me so dearly,<br />
Never poor wench lov'd so: Sir believe me,<br />
'Twas the most dutious wench, the best companion,<br />
When I was pleas'd, the happiest, and the gladdest,<br />
The modestest sweet nature dwelt within her:<br />
I saw all this, I knew all this, I lov'd it,<br />
I doated on it too, and yet I kill'd it:<br />
O what have I forsaken? what have I lost?<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> Madam, I'le take my leave, since she is wandring,<br />
'Tis fit I know no rest.<br />
<br />
<i>Oly.</i> Will you go too Sir?<br />
I have not wrong'd you yet, if you dare trust me,<br />
For yet I love <i>Alinda</i> there, I honour her,<br />
I love to look upon those eyes that speak her,<br />
To read that face again, (modesty keep me,)<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span><i>Alinda</i>, in that shape: but why should you trust me,<br />
'Twas I betray'd your Sister, I undid her;<br />
And believe me, gentle youth, 'tis I weep for her:<br />
Appoint what penance you please: but stay then,<br />
And see me perform it: ask what honour this place<br />
Is able to heap on ye, or what wealth:<br />
If following me will like ye, my care of ye,<br />
Which for your sisters sake, for your own goodness&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> Not all the honour earth has, now she's gone Lady,<br />
Not all the favour; yet if I sought preferment,<br />
Under your bounteous Grace I would only take it.<br />
Peace rest upon ye: one sad tear every day<br />
For poor <i>Alindas</i>. sake, 'tis fit ye pay.      <span class="ralign">[<i>Exit.</i></span><br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
